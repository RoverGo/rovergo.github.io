Do you host MariaDB in Azure? Do you need to schedule scripts in MariaDB? We now fully support [Azure Database for MariaDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mariadb/). Of course, you can also use RoverGo with any instance of MariaDB, even if it's not hosted in Azure.

We also support [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/), [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/) and of course, [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/).
