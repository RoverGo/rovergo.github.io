You spoke and we listened! We adjusted our [pricing plans]({{site.rovergo_website}}/Pricing) to be more suitable for SQL maintenance tasks. We now offer longer run times so you can execute scripts to rebuild indexes on large tables, purge large amounts of data, aggregate data for complex reports, etc.

We also offer custom plans tailored for your specific needs. [Get in touch]({{site.rovergo_website}}/Contact) for a quote. Still not sure if RoverGo is right for you? Sign up for a [free trial]({{site.rovergo_portal}}/Account/Register) so you can try it out before purchasing a plan.

What do you think? We'd love to hear more of your feedback. You can take our [short survey](https://goo.gl/forms/nsAvsoobDGggM19n2) (and get two months free!) or [contact us]({{site.rovergo_website}}/Contact) directly.
