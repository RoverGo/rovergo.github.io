Do you host MariaDB in Azure? Do you need to schedule scripts in MariaDB? We now fully support [Azure Database for MariaDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mariadb/). Of course, you can also use RoverGo with any instance of MariaDB, even if it's not hosted in Azure.

[Sign up today]({{site.rovergo_portal}}/Account/Register) for a free trial to schedule your first MariaDB task.
