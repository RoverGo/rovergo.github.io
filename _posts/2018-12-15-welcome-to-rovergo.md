Welcome to RoverGo! With [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/), you can schedule scripts on your Azure databases just like you could with SQL Server Agent. Do you need to purge old files, run daily updates, calculate aggregates for reporting, or import data? You can with [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/). You can schedule anything you can script in SQL. We support MySQL and SQL Server.

Not using Azure databases? You can still use [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/) to schedule your tasks in a centralized portal for all of your database servers.

Next, [let's get started with your first task](/getting-started).
