Welcome to RoverGo! With [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/), you can schedule scripts on your Azure databases just like you could with SQL Server Agent. Do you need to automate any of the following?

- purge old files
- run daily updates
- calculate aggregates for reporting
- import data
- rebuild indexes
- etc

You can with [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/). You can schedule anything you can script. We support both MySQL and SQL Server.

Not using Azure databases? You can still use [RoverGo](https://rovergo.io/) to schedule your tasks in a centralized portal for all of your database servers.

[Let's get started with your first task](/getting-started).
