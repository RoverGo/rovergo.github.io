Do you host PostgreSQL in Azure? Do you need to schedule scripts in PostgreSQL? We now fully support [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/). Of course, you can also use RoverGo with any instance of PostgreSQL, even if it's not hosted in Azure.

[Sign up today]({{site.rovergo_portal}}/Account/Register) for a free trial to schedule your first PostgreSQL task.
